# Farm Management System (Bukid–Pitak–Worker)

A desktop application built with **Electron** and **Vite React/TypeScript** to streamline labor and financial management in farming.  
The system focuses on organizing workers per pitak, tracking debts, calculating payments based on luwang (piecework), and supporting manual deductions for fairness and transparency.  
Originally designed for kabisilya workflows, now expanded into a **general farm management system**.

## ✨ Features

- **Worker Registry**  
  Maintain a list of all workers, assignable per pitak.  
  Track worker status (active, on-leave, terminated) with audit-safe updates.

- **Pitak Assignment**  
  Assign workers to specific pitak and record the number of luwang completed.  
  Group assignments by bukid, pitak, status, or cropping session.

- **Payment Calculation (Pakyawan per Luwang)**  
  Compute gross pay based on fixed rate (e.g., ₱230 per luwang).  
  Allow manual deduction of debts to avoid full automatic deduction.  
  Track net pay, pending balances, and generate per-pitak payroll summaries.

- **Debt Management**  
  Record, update, and monitor worker debts.  
  Deduction history per payout for audit safety.  
  Support partial payments and transparent balance tracking.

- **Filtering & Reporting**  
  Unified tables with filters by bukid, pitak, worker, or payment status.  
  Generate reports for pending payments, cleared debts, productivity per pitak, and payroll summaries per bukid.

- **Notifications**  
  Audit-safe events such as:  
  - `pitak_assignment_updated`  
  - `payment_pending`  
  - `payment_completed`  
  - `debt_updated`  
  - `bukid_settings_updated`

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Electron** – Desktop app runtime  
- **Vite** – Fast build tool and dev server  
- **React + TypeScript** – Frontend framework and type safety  
- **SQLite / Postgres (optional)** – For persistent storage of workers, assignments, debts, and payments

## 📊 Database Schema (Simplified)

**Workers**  
- `worker_id`, `name`, `status`, `contact`, `email`, `address`, `hire_date`, `total_debt`, `total_paid`, `current_balance`

**Bukid**  
- `bukid_id`, `name`, `location`, `status`

**Pitak**  
- `pitak_id`, `bukid_id`, `location`, `size`, `status`

**Assignments**  
- `assignment_id`, `pitak_id`, `worker_id`, `luwang_count`, `status`, `assignment_date`

**Payments**  
- `payment_id`, `worker_id`, `pitak_id`, `gross_pay`, `manual_deduction`, `net_pay`, `status`, `payment_date`

**Debts**  
- `debt_id`, `worker_id`, `amount`, `balance`, `status`, `created_at`

**UserActivity (Audit Log)**  
- `activity_id`, `user_id`, `action`, `description`, `details`, `created_at`
